		<h1>Adapting Antiquity Project Overview</h1>
		<p>For my master's project, I will be developing a long-form piece of narrative journalism that explores the recent trend of musical theater adaptations of Greek mythology. This project will seek to learn what draws composers to these myths, how they alter them to fit modern storytelling and themes, what the compositional process is like, and how cast members and tech crew, etc. contribute to the adaptation. Musicals that I will be looking at include:</p>

		<p>By looking at these specific musicals, I will also explore subtrends in these adaptations, including the focus on the Homeric epics and Underworld mythology, urban fantasy reimaginings and the recent influx of musicals being developed over social media platforms.</p>

	<p>Hi! I'm Kiana Fernandes, a master's student at the University of Missouri School of Journalism. I completed my undergraduate degree at the same university in May 2024 with an emphasis in cross-platform editing and producing. As someone interested in arts and culture reporting and editing, I wanted to spend my time as a master's student diving deep into an artistic suptopic I find interesting: musical theater. I have also spent my life as a fan of Greek mythology, being first introduced to the stories as a child reading Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson series. I have since graduated to reading Homer and Ovid and Euripides, but my love for these ancient stories have never wavered. I think there is a lot we can learn about ourselves in the modern day through the ancient stories we have kept alive by telling and retelling them.</p>

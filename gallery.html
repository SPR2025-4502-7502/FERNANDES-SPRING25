				<h1>The Stonework of Westminster Abbey</h1>
					<p>In May 2024, my parents took me to London and Edinburgh as a gift for completing my undergraduate degree. One of the places I will never forget visiting is Westminster Abbey. I have never seen another building designed so beautifully, with brilliant stonework covering almost every inch of its surface. The following images represent only a small portion of the thousands of stone details in the abbey – and they are the ones that most spoke to me while visiting.</p>

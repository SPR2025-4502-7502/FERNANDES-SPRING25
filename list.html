<h1>8 Modern Musicals that Retell or Reimagine Greek Mythology</h1>
<p>There has been a recent increase in the number of musicals being produced that either retell or reimagine well-known Greek myths. Although there have been mythological musicals since the first few decades of the genre's establishment in American culture, the uptick starting in 2019 with Hadestown is what I am focusing my master's project on. For my own reference, I have compiled this list of retellings and reimaginings.</p>

<h2>The Golden Apple (1954)</h2>
<h3>By Jerome Moross and John Treville Latouche</h3>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81lhL+dJ3YL._SX466_.jpg" alt="The Golden Apple's album cover features a lime green background with a golden apple silhouette over top of the center. On top of the apple is an illustration of a man in a tuxedo surrounded by women dressed like cabaret dancers, all in dramatic poses, some of whom are draped over him. The Golden Apple is written in a blocky sans serif font, and beneath it are the names of the people involved with the recording. The album was produced by RCA Victor.">
<p>The Golden Apple opened Off-Broadway on March 11, 1954. It is a turn-of-the-century retelling of The Iliad that takes place in Washington State in the town of Angel's Roost, near Mt. Olumpus. Menelaus's wife Helen runs off with a traveling salesman named Paris, who is visitin gthe town to judge an apple pie baking contest. Ulysses, who has just come back from military service, leaves his wife Penelope on a ten-year expedition to bring Helen back.</p>

<h2>The Frogs (1974)</h2>
<h3>By Stephen Sondheim and Burt Shevelove</h3>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QOSsAuj6L._UX500_FMwebp_QL85_.jpg" alt="The album cover for The Frogs has a beige background. On top of it is a Greek-style vase with the musical's title written in a standard Americanized ancient Greek font. On the base of the vase are the words 'A New Musical.' Coming out of the top of the vase is the top half of a frog, holding a red book and a martini with olives. At the bottom of the cover is a horizontal strip designed to look like green marble with the words 'Original Broadway Cast Recording.'">
<p>The Frogs is adapted from the ancient comedic play of the same name by Aristophanes. In the musical, the god Dionysos travels to Hades to bring George Bernard Shaw back from the dead. However, Dionysos ends up returning with Shakespeare instead, after he proves himself the better playwright. The god hopes Shakespeare's return will revitalize art and save civilization.</p>

<h2>Paris: The Musical (1990)</h2>
<h3>By Jon English and David Mackay</h3>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/418leX99arL._UX500_FMwebp_QL85_.jpg" alt="The album cover for Paris has a black background. On this background is an ancient greek helmet with a plume shaped like a horse's head and heart detailings over the ears. Atop this image is the text, 'Paris: He followed his heart, He trusted the Gods, He should have known better...' in all caps. Smaller, at the bottom of the album cover, it reads 'written by Jon English and David Mackay.' All type is in a white, ancient Greek-style font.">
<p>Paris, like The Golden Apple, is an Iliad retelling. This time, though, the story is told from the Trojan hero and wife-stealer Paris's perspective through rock music. The musical is about Paris and Helen's love story, although other figures from the epic, like Menelaus, Achilles and Patroclus, do feature. Paris juggles themes of passion vs. order, law vs. chaos, and head vs. heart.</p>

<h2>Lysistrata Jones (2011)</h2>
<h3>By Douglas Carter Beane and Lewis Flinn</h3>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/819algptdhL._SX466_.jpg" alt="The album cover features Lysistrata Jones in a cheerleading uniform, raising her fist in triumph in front of a blued-out photo of other women at Athens University. At her feet, on a yellow background, are five members of the university's men's basketball team. On top of Lysistrata is the musical's name and its status as an original Broadway cast recording.">
<p>Lysistrata Jones is a modern, high school retelling of Aristophanes' comedy Lysistrata. In the musical, the men's basketball team at Athens University hasn't won a game in the last 30 years. Cheerleader Lysistrata Jones convinces the other girls at school to stop sleeping with members of the team until they finally win a game.</p>

<h2>Pandemonium! A Greek Myth-Adventure (2015)</h2>
<h3>By Jenifer Toksvig and David Perkins</h3>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ZsTcM-QEL.jpg" alt="I could not locate an album for this musical, only the libretto. This version of the libretto's cover is red, with the first third decorated by some white vertical lines and an open book with the letter s on one page and the letter f on the other. Beneath the book are the comedy and tragedy masks. On the remaining two-thirds of the page is the following information in white text, 'Pandemonium! A Greek Myth-Adventre. Book and lyrics by Jenifer Toksvig, music by David Perkins. Samuel French Acting Edition.'">
<p>Pandemonium! is a show designed for middle and high school-aged performers and tells the story of Pandora's Box. At her wedding to Epimetheus, Pandora is gifted a mysterious box by Zeus. When she opens it, all manner of evil is released into the world. Pandora runs away with the box, and gods and mortals must work together to find her.</p>

<h2>The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical (2017)</h2>
<h3>By Rob Rokicki and Joe Tracz</h3>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511UqqJaTfL._UX500_FMwebp_QL85_.jpg" alt="The album cover for The Lightning Thief has a blue-black brick background with what looks like a gold metal lightning bolt outline on top of it in the center. The musical's title is over this bold, with an indication that it is the original cast's deluxe edition in the bottom left corner.">
<p>The Lightning Thief is an adaptation of Rick Riordan's 2005 novel of the same name. It follows Percy Jackson, a young demigod son of Poseidon, as he learns about his godly roots and goes on a quest to save his mother and return Zeus's masterbolt to Olympus, where it had been stolen. He does so with the help of Grover, a satyr and his best friend, and Annabeth, a daughter of Athena who isn't sure what to make of this supposed "hero" of prophecy.</p>

<h2>Hadestown (2019)</h2>
<h3>By By Anaïs Mitchell</h3>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51YwhIKDnxL._UX500_FMwebp_QL85_.jpg" alt="The album cover has a smoky black and sepia background that looks kind of like old film grain. In the center is a sepia photo of a hand holding a bright red carnation. Above this is the text 'Original Broadway Cast Recording,' and below the graphic is the musical's title as well as the names of the composer, Anaïs Mitchell, and the director, Rachel Chavkin.">
<p>Hadestown is a retelling of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth, set in a dystopian world where the seasons have been thrown out of sync by Hades and Persephone's failing relationship. The musical addresses how love can bloom and survive in late stage capitalism, where hunger drives people to extremes. When Eurydice follows Hades to his industrial city to escape the bitter cold, Orpheus must try to use his power of songwriting to save her and melt the heart of the King of the Underworld.</p>

<h2>Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical (2023)</h2>
<h3>By Summerfall Studios</h3>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61GQfCqThvL._UX500_FMwebp_QL85_.jpg" alt="I chose to use the Pantheon Edition of the game's soundtrack, because it is the most comprehensive. However, there are three other albums that follow each of the main decision paths that players can take. This cover is an illustration. Five of the game's characters appear in the ruins of a Greek temple with sound equipment, as if they're preparing for a concert. This image is meant to look like it takes place at dusk. The overall color scheme of the design falls in predominantly purple and blue tones, with a lot of black as well. The cover has the game's logo, the edition of the album, and the names of people involved in its production.">
<p>Stray Gods is a video game that allows players to choose their own musical adventure. They assume the role of Grace, a college dropout who has been accused of murdering the last muse, Calliope. Grace has to prove her innocence to Athena, Apollo, Persephone and Aphrodite, all within seven days. Having inherited Calliope's musical gift after her death, Grace uses song to try to learn the truth behind the muse's death.</p>

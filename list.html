  <h1>8 Modern Musicals that Retell or Reimagine Greek Mythology</h1>
  <p>There has been a recent increase in the number of musicals being produced that either retell or reimagine well-known Greek myths. Although there have been mythological musicals since the first few decades of the genre's establishment in American culture, the uptick starting in 2019 with Hadestown is what I am focusing my master's project on. For my own reference, I have compiled this list of retellings and reimaginings.</p>

On top of the apple is an illustration of a man in a tuxedo surrounded by women dressed like cabaret dancers, all in dramatic poses, some of whom are draped over him. The Golden Apple is written in a blocky sans serif font, and beneath it are the names of the people involved with the recording. The album was produced by RCA Victor.">

On top of it is a Greek-style vase with the musical's title written in a standard Americanized ancient Greek font. On the base of the vase are the words 'A New Musical.' Coming out of the top of the vase is the top half of a frog, holding a red book and a martini with olives.

However, there are three other albums that follow each of the main decision paths that players can take. This cover is an illustration. Five of the game's characters appear in the ruins of a Greek temple with sound equipment, as if they're preparing for a concert. This image is meant to look like it takes place at dusk. The overall color scheme of the design falls in predominantly purple and blue tones, with a lot of black as well. The cover has the game's logo, the edition of the album, and the names of people involved in its production.">

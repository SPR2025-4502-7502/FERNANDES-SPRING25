<h1>8 Modern Musicals that Retell or Reimagine Greek Mythology</h1>
<p>There has been a recent increase in the number of musicals being produced that either retell or reimagine well-known Greek myths. Although there have been mythological musicals since the first few decades of the genre's establishment in American culture, the uptick starting in 2019 with Hadestown is what I am focusing my master's project on. For my own reference, I have compiled this list of retellings and reimaginings.</p>

On top of the apple is an illustration of a man in a tuxedo surrounded by women dressed like cabaret dancers, all in dramatic poses, some of whom are draped over him. The Golden Apple is written in a blocky sans serif font, and beneath it are the names of the people involved with the recording. The album was produced by RCA Victor.">

<h2>The Golden Apple (1954)</h2>

On top of it is a Greek-style vase with the musical's title written in a standard Americanized ancient Greek font. On the base of the vase are the words 'A New Musical.'

<h2>Paris: The Musical (1990)</h2>
<h3>By Jon English and David Mackay</h3>
<p>Paris, like The Golden Apple, is an Iliad retelling. This time, though, the story is told from the Trojan hero and wife-stealer Paris's perspective through rock music. The musical is about Paris and Helen's love story, although other figures from the epic, like Menelaus, Achilles and Patroclus, do feature. Paris juggles themes of passion vs. order, law vs. chaos, and head vs. heart.</p>

<h2>Xanadu on Broadway (2007)</h2>

<h2>Hadestown (2019)</h2>
<h3>By By Anaïs Mitchell</h3>
<p>Hadestown is a retelling of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth, set in a dystopian world where the seasons have been thrown out of sync by Hades and Persephone's failing relationship. The musical addresses how love can bloom and survive in late stage capitalism, where hunger drives people to extremes. When Eurydice follows Hades to his industrial city to escape the bitter cold, Orpheus must try to use his power of songwriting to save her and melt the heart of the King of the Underworld.</p>

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61GQfCqThvL._UX500_FMwebp_QL85_.jpg" class="contentimage" alt="I chose to use the Pantheon Edition of the game's soundtrack, because it is the most comprehensive. However, there are three other albums that follow each of the main decision paths that players can take. This cover is an illustration. Five of the game's characters appear in the ruins of a Greek temple with sound equipment, as if they're preparing for a concert. This image is meant to look like it takes place at dusk. The overall color scheme of the design falls in predominantly purple and blue tones, with a lot of black as well. The cover has the game's logo, the edition of the album, and the names of people involved in its production.">
